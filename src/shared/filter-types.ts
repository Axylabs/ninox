/**
 * Strict, schema-aware query filter.
 *
 * The driver's own `Filter<T>` is deliberately loose: its `RootFilterOperators`
 * extends `Document` (`{ [key: string]: any }`), so `Filter<PreciseDoc>` still
 * accepts ANY top-level key. This type re-declares the field-level portion of
 * the filter plus the root operators WITHOUT inheriting that index signature,
 * so a typo'd or undeclared field is a compile error on object literals.
 *
 * It is a strict subset of the driver's `Filter<T>`, so the ORM bridges it with
 * a cast only at the driver boundary.
